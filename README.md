# Canny-Edge-Detection
Canny Edge Detection Pipeline in C++ (without using OpenCV). Requires that the input image is in P3 (ASCII) ppm format.

The program first loads the input PPM into a 2D vector. 

![Initial image.](empire_pngs/empire%20-%20Copy.png)

It then converts the image to a grayscale:

![Grayscaled image.](empire_pngs/empire_grayscale%20-%20Copy.png)
